            week 2-into to JS
            This week learning JS was HARD! I have been having a tough time wrapping my head around all the new info
            coming at me
            and how to utilize it all on a complete app. I feel like I understand conditionals a little more. I
            understand how to
            set them up and the syntax, just a little lost on what logic to write in them to solve the problem. I also
            struggled big
            time with functions. I am starting to understand the purpose of them, but I still don't know what to write
            in them or
            how to use them along with other functions. I am also struggling to understand DOM manipulation. Lots to
            learn still!!!
            Trying to focus on just practicing and keeping my head up!

            week 3-MVC
            I forgot to write in my journal, so that pretty much sums up that week!

            week 4-Async code and observer pattern
            This week we learned about asynchronise code and the observer pattern in MVC. The concepts have been
            challenging, but the overall pattern is starting to make more sense as we go. I am still relying pretty
            heavy on past projects to see how to write the functions, but I am making progress in understanding what I
            am doing and that is a pretty big win!
